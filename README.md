# NHL-goal-light

This enables Raspberry Pi (RPi) to access the NHL API and activate a goal light for when your favourite team scores.
This uses a pinout (default 23) to activate the LED or an infrared emitter for a "Fan Fever Goal Light"

The team can be set by creating 'team.txt' and typing in the teams name. If this is not present it will create a 'team.txt' by default.

A delay time is featured to allow a pause in time for TV/Streaming delays, this time is in seconds.
This also set by creating a 'delay.txt', and it will also create the file if it is not present.
